# Build Larabook From Scratch *(Laravel 5.1)*

Been using Laravel for some time, and now feel ready to build a well-architected application from scratch? Excellent! Together, let's build a light version of Facebook, called Larabook.

## Lessons summary

### 1. [The Virtual Machine](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-from-scratch/episodes/1)

To begin our new project, let's setup a virtual machine, using Vagrant and Laravel Homestead.

**Please note: I rebuilt it with Laravel 5.1, so the projet in this repository may be a little bit different**

### 2. [Dependencies](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-from-scratch/episodes/2)

There are a number of dependencies that we'll need to pull in for this project. While even a few years ago, this might have been a pain, luckily that's no longer the case, thanks to Composer.

**Please note: The only dependency I pulled in is Jeffreyâ€™s Generators, for the rest I decided to use Laravel 5.1 built-in features.**
